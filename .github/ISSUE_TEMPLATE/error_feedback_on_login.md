**Title:**
As a user, I want to receive a message if I enter the wrong username or password so that I know my login attempt was unsuccessful.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
	1.	If the username or password is incorrect, the system displays an error message (e.g., “Invalid username or password”).
	2.	The error message is visible and easy to understand.
	3.	The login form remains on screen so the user can try again.
	4.	No access is granted to the account until valid credentials are entered.

**Priority:** High

**Story Points:** 2

**Notes:**
	•	Error message should not reveal which field (username or password) was incorrect for security reasons.
	•	Consider accessibility (screen readers, color contrast for error text).
