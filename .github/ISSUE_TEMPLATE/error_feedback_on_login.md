**Title:**
As a user, I want to receive a message if I enter the wrong username or password so that I know my login attempt was unsuccessful.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
	1.	If the username or password is incorrect, the system displays an error message (e.g., “Invalid username or password”).<br>
	2.	The error message is visible and easy to understand.<br>
	3.	The login form remains on screen so the user can try again.<br>
	4.	No access is granted to the account until valid credentials are entered.<br>

**Priority:** High

**Story Points:** 2

**Notes:**
	1.	Error message should not reveal which field (username or password) was incorrect for security reasons.<br>
	2.	Consider accessibility (screen readers, color contrast for error text).
